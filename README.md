# React Attractive Inputs

Two production ready advance input code that you can use as reference or copy as it is in your next project.



## One Time Password (OTP) Input with Validation

This input box is designed as a unique feature. As the user enters the OTP (One-Time Password), it continuously verifies its correctness in real-time. If the OTP is incorrect, an error message appears below the input box, accompanied by a subtle shaking animation to draw the user's attention to the issue.

## Password Input with Validation

This special input box employs real-time validation to ensure the strength and security of the user's password. As the user types, it actively checks for the presence of essential elements such as numbers, capital letters, and special characters to guarantee a strong password. If the password is too short or lacks any of these crucial components, an error message is displayed below the input box, accompanied by a subtle shaking animation, drawing the user's attention to rectify the issue and create a more robust password.
